## What This Vault Is

This Obsidian vault manages the **Inner Loop OS (ILOS)** strategy, ontology schema, and project execution as an integrated knowledge system.

**Inner Loop OS** is a behavioral OS that treats human emotion-eating-habit-reward-nervous system loops as a unified system.

**Core Philosophy**: "An organization that kills hypotheses quickly to find what survives"

### This Vault Contains
1. **10-year vision**: Human Inner Loop OS as global standard
2. **Strategic hypotheses**: Meta Hypotheses (MH1-4), Conditions (A-E), Tracks (1-6)
3. **Ontology schema**: Data models (Event, Episode, ActionExecution, etc.)
4. **Project execution**: Track-based Projects and Tasks
5. **Hypothesis validation**: Logs of hypotheses being tested
6. **Real implementations**: Links to SoSi and KkokKkokFit projects

---

## Strategic Hierarchy (Critical Concept)

```
10-year Vision (North Star) - Immutable
 └─ Meta Hypotheses (MH1-4) - If ANY breaks → reconsider company
     └─ 3-year Conditions (A-E) - When met → unlock; when broken → specific pivot/shutdown
         └─ 12-month Tracks (1-6) - Investment direction hypotheses
             └─ Projects - Experiment units
                 └─ Tasks - Execution units
```

### Core Principles
1. **Vision is fixed, strategy is conditional**
2. **Metrics ≠ goals**, metrics = shutdown signals
3. **Bad results ≠ failure**, bad results = hypothesis generation opportunities
4. **Condition broken → clear pivot/shutdown decision**

**Examples**:
- Condition B (10 reproducible patterns) broken → Data strategy shutdown
- MH3 (data modeling possible) false → Reconsider company's reason to exist

---

## Architecture: Ontology-Strategy Relationship (CRITICAL)

### Ontology's 3 Roles

#### 1. Validates MH3
**MH3**: "Loops can be modeled as data"

**How ontology validates**:
- Can Loop data be represented with 5 core entities?
- Does Event-Action-Result causal structure work?
- Can reproducible patterns be stored as data?

**Current status**: 70% validated (positive)
**If MH3 false** → Reconsider company existence

#### 2. Enables Condition B
**Condition B**: "10 reproducible patterns"

**How ontology enables**:
- Converts patterns to Event-Episode-Action-Outcome data
- Makes pattern reproduction testing possible
- Makes pattern counting possible

**If Condition B breaks** → Data strategy shutdown, cannot enter 3-year strategy
**Without ontology** → Cannot measure Condition B

#### 3. Core Component of Track 2
**Track 2 (Data)**: "Coach + log data can be patterned"

**Ontology = Focus 3 of Track 2** (Schema stabilization)

**Track 2 success conditions**:
- High-density users: 50 ✅
- Reproducible patterns: 10 ← **Ontology required**
- Schema stability: 3 months ← **Ontology required**

## Immutable Rules (v0.1 Frozen Specification)

### NEVER CHANGE (v0.1)
- ❌ 5 core entities (Event, Episode, LoopStateWindow, ActionExecution, OutcomeMeasurement) - no deletion/semantic changes
- ❌ ID field names (eventId, episodeId, stateWindowId, actionExecutionId, outcomeId)
- ❌ Reference structure (episodeId, actionExecutionId references)
- ❌ Common fields (id, userId, createdAt, updatedAt, source, specVersion)
- ❌ 4-condition rules (Rule A-D)

### Allowed Changes
- ✅ Add new entities (doesn't violate Rule A)
- ✅ Add new fields (preserve existing field semantics)
- ✅ Expand payload internal structure

### Strategy Document Principles
- ❌ Never set metrics as goals (they are shutdown signals only)
- ❌ Never use "success/failure" terms (use "hypothesis validation/falsification")
- ✅ Always specify clear response when Condition breaks
- ✅ Always include if_broken field

## Using the loop-entity-creator Skill

The `loop-entity-creator` skill is a managed skill that automates Task and Project creation with proper ID generation, schema validation, and graph index updates.

### When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User asks to "create a new task" or "create a new project"
- User wants to add a task to an existing project
- User needs to edit or delete Tasks/Projects
- You need to ensure proper ID generation and schema compliance

### How It Works

**For Tasks:**
1. Collects required info (project_id, assignee, priority)
2. Auto-generates next Task ID (e.g., `tsk:003-02`)
3. Creates file in correct location (`50_Projects/{project}/Tasks/`)
4. Runs validation and updates graph index

**For Projects:**
1. Collects required info (owner, parent_id)
2. Auto-generates next Project ID (e.g., `prj:008`)
3. Creates project directory structure with `Tasks/` and `Results/` subfolders
4. Creates `Project_정의.md` file
5. Runs validation and updates graph index

### Example Usage

Instead of manually creating files:
```bash
# DON'T do this manually:
Write file to 50_Projects/P008_NewProject/Tasks/task.md
```

Use the skill:
```bash
# DO this instead:
Invoke the loop-entity-creator skill
Let it collect info and auto-generate IDs
```

## Common Workflows

### Create New Strategy Hypothesis
1. Determine hypothesis type (MetaHypothesis, Condition, Track, Hypothesis)
2. Copy template from `00_Meta/_TEMPLATES/template_*.md`
3. Create document in appropriate folder (`01_North_Star/`, `20_Strategy/`)
4. Replace `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` with actual values
5. Write YAML frontmatter (entity_type, if_broken, validates/enables)
6. Specify relationships (parent/child hypotheses, ontology connections)
7. Regenerate `_Graph_Index.md`: `python3 scripts/build_graph_index.py .`
8. Update related MOC files

### Create New Ontology Entity
1. Create document in `30_Ontology/Entities/`
2. YAML frontmatter must include **strategy_link** section
3. Write **hypothesis_contribution** (which hypothesis does this validate?)
4. Write 3-level summary (executive/technical/detailed)
5. Add relations section (table format)
6. Include JSON examples
7. Update `_MOC 온톨로지 개발.md`
8. Update `_Graph_Index.md`

### Ontology-Strategy Gap Analysis
1. Write ontology spec
2. Check actual implementations (SoSi/KkokKkokFit)
3. Analyze gaps:
   - In ontology only → Implementation plan
   - In implementation only → Extend ontology
4. Reconcile:
   - Ontology better → Propose implementation change (migration)
   - Implementation more realistic → Adjust ontology (must not violate v0.1 rules)
5. Document results in `70_Experiments/Use-cases/`

### Update Condition Status
1. Open Condition document (`20_Strategy/3Y_Conditions/`)
2. Update metrics current value
3. Reassess risk_level
4. Check break_triggers (make shutdown decision if met)
5. Check related Track/Project status
6. Update `_Graph_Index.md`

---

## Validation & Automation

### Python Scripts

**Requirements**: Python 3.9+ with PyYAML

**Installation options**:
```bash
# Option 1: Direct install
pip install pyyaml

# Option 2: Using Poetry (recommended)
poetry install
```

**Project configuration**: See `pyproject.toml` for exact dependency versions.

#### ID Format Reference
| Prefix | Pattern | Example | Entity Type |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ns:` | `ns:NNN` | `ns:001` | NorthStar |
| `mh:` | `mh:1-4` | `mh:3` | MetaHypothesis |
| `cond:` | `cond:a-e` | `cond:b` | Condition |
| `trk:` | `trk:1-6` | `trk:2` | Track |
| `prj:` | `prj:NNN` | `prj:003` | Project |
| `tsk:` | `tsk:NNN-NN` | `tsk:003-01` | Task |
| `hyp:` | `hyp:NNN` | `hyp:001` | Hypothesis |
| `exp:` | `exp:NNN` | `exp:001` | Experiment |

#### 1. Validate Schema
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_schema.py .
```
- Checks required fields for each entity type
- Validates ID format patterns
- Verifies status values
- Ensures parent_id references are valid

**Scans**: `01_North_Star/`, `20_Strategy/`, `50_Projects/`, `60_Hypotheses/`, `70_Experiments/`
**Excludes**: `00_Meta/_TEMPLATES/`, `10_Study/`, `30_Ontology/`, `40_LOOP_OS/`, `90_Archive/`

#### 2. Check Orphans
```bash
python3 scripts/check_orphans.py .
```
- Finds parent_id references to non-existent entities
- Checks project_id and hypothesis_id validity
- Verifies validates/validated_by symmetry
- Reports broken outgoing_relations

**Note**: Currently reports warnings but doesn't block commits

#### 3. Build Graph Index
```bash
python3 scripts/build_graph_index.py .
```
- Scans all entities with frontmatter
- Derives children_ids from parent_id
- Derives incoming_relations from outgoing_relations
- Creates summary tables and relationship maps
- Flags critical entities

**Auto-runs**: On every commit via pre-commit hook

### Setting Up Pre-commit Hook

**Note**: The pre-commit hook is already installed in this repository. If you need to reinstall it:

```bash
# Create the hook file
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Running schema validation..."
python3 scripts/validate_schema.py . || {
  echo "❌ Schema validation failed. Commit blocked."
  exit 1
}

echo "🔗 Checking for orphans..."
python3 scripts/check_orphans.py . || {
  echo "⚠️  Orphan check warnings (not blocking)"
}

echo "📊 Rebuilding graph index..."
python3 scripts/build_graph_index.py . || {
  echo "❌ Graph index build failed. Commit blocked."
  exit 1
}

# Stage the updated index if it changed
if [ -f "_Graph_Index.md" ]; then
  git add _Graph_Index.md
  echo "✅ _Graph_Index.md updated and staged"
fi

echo "✅ All pre-commit checks passed!"
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**What the hook does**:
- ✅ **Validates schema** (blocks commit on error)
- ⚠️ **Checks orphans** (warns only, doesn't block)
- ✅ **Rebuilds graph index** (blocks commit on error, auto-stages `_Graph_Index.md`)

#### 4. Import Tasks from CSV
```bash
python3 scripts/csv_to_loop_entities.py <csv_file>
```
- Converts CSV task exports (e.g., from Notion) to Project/Task entities
- Automatically creates Project and Task frontmatter
- Maps priority levels (high/medium/low)
- Sanitizes file names
- Creates folder structure under `50_Projects/`

**Input CSV format**: Should include columns for project name, task name, status, priority, assignee

#### 5. Build Dashboard (Optional)
```bash
python3 scripts/build_dashboard.py .
```
- Generates an HTML dashboard at `_dashboard/index.html`
- Provides visual overview of Projects and Tasks
- Shows status distribution, priority breakdown, and progress tracking
- Useful for project management and team coordination

**Output location**: `_dashboard/index.html` (can be opened in any browser)

#### 6. Deploy to Synology NAS (Production)
```bash
# On NAS (via SSH)
/volume1/scripts/deploy-kanban.sh
```
- Auto-pulls from GitHub
- Validates schema
- Rebuilds dashboard
- Deploys to Web Station (http://nas-ip:8080)
- Logs to `/volume1/logs/kanban-deploy.log`

**Automated**: Runs every 15 minutes via Task Scheduler

For complete NAS deployment guide, see: `NAS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## GraphRAG Questions This Vault Should Answer

**Global questions** (overall context):
- "What is this company's 10-year goal?" → Inner Loop OS global standard
- "Why build ontology?" → Validate MH3 + Enable Condition B + Execute Track 2
- "If MH3 is false?" → Reconsider company's reason to exist

**Conditional questions** (If-Then):
- "If Condition B breaks?" → Data strategy shutdown → Abandon 3-year strategy
- "If ontology fails?" → MH3 at risk → Company review OR redesign v0.2
- "If patterns don't reach 10?" → Condition B unmet → Data strategy shutdown

**Relationship questions** (connections):
- "Which hypothesis does Event entity validate?" → MH3 (data modeling possible)
- "What's the relationship between Track 2 and ontology?" → Ontology is Focus 3 of Track 2
- "What unlocks when ontology succeeds?" → Condition B → 3-year strategy → Medical entry

**Timeline questions** (time series):
- "Success conditions after 12 months?" → Condition A,B clarified + Condition D secured
- "3-year strategy entry conditions?" → Condition A,B,D,E met
- "What triggers ontology v0.1 → v0.2?" → 3 months stability + 10 patterns + new requirements

---

## Important Notes

### Obsidian Vault Characteristics
- **No code execution**: This is a knowledge management vault, not a software project
- **No build commands**: No `npm`, `cargo`, `go build`, etc.
- **No tests**: No unit tests or integration tests
- **Markdown-centric**: All work focuses on creating, editing, and structuring `.md` files

### Real Implementation Projects
This vault manages strategy and ontology **specifications**. Actual implementations:
- **SoSi**: `/Users/gim-eunhyang/dev/flutter/sosi`
- **KkokKkokFit**: `/Users/gim-eunhyang/dev/flutter/kkokkkokfit_web`

**When to reference implementations:**
- Ontology-implementation gap analysis
- Validating that ontology entities map to real data structures
- Checking if v0.1 spec constraints match actual usage
- Gathering evidence for hypothesis validation (e.g., MH3)

**Important**: Do NOT make changes to implementation code from this vault. This vault is for specification and strategy only.

| Content Type | Location | Example | Status |
|--------------|----------|---------|--------|
| 10-year vision/Meta Hypotheses | `01_North_Star/` | MH3 document | Partial |
| 3-year Conditions | `20_Strategy/3Y_Conditions/` | Condition B | Partial |
| 12-month Tracks | `20_Strategy/12M_Tracks/` | Track 2 | Complete |
| Ontology entities | `30_Ontology/Entities/` | Event definition | Partial |
| Ontology relations | `30_Ontology/Relations/` | contains relation | Planned |
| Ontology rules | `30_Ontology/Rules/` | Rule A | Planned |
| Ontology-strategy link | `30_Ontology/_Strategy_Link.md` | Strategy link | Planned |
| Projects | `50_Projects/P{N}_{Name}/` | Ontology v0.1 | Planned |
| Hypothesis validation | `60_Hypotheses/` | Loop modeling | Planned |
| Experiment results | `70_Experiments/Use-cases/` | Validation results | Folder exists |
| Templates | `00_Meta/_TEMPLATES/` | Strategy/ontology templates | Exists |

### When Creating Strategy Documents
1. Clearly specify **entity_type** (NorthStar, MetaHypothesis, Condition, Track, Project, Task)
2. Specify **if_broken** condition (what gets triggered?)
3. Specify **enables/validated_by** relationships
4. Emphasize **metrics are shutdown signals, not goals**

### When Creating Ontology Documents
1. **strategy_link** section required (validates, enables, supports)
2. Add **hypothesis_contribution** section
3. Specify **community** membership
4. Write **multi-level summaries** (executive/technical/detailed)
5. **Include examples** (JSON, scenarios)

### Document Relationships
- Strategy → Ontology: `validates`, `enables`, `supports`
- Within ontology: `contains`, `evaluatedBy`, `precedes`, `triggers`
- Within strategy: `unlocks`, `triggersShutdown`, `implements`
