notes: 'Dear Johann Hari,


  Warm greetings from Korea. I recently read your book, *Magic Pill*, and was deeply
  moved. When you wrote about how often we hurriedly eat our food without even realizing
  the emotional void we are trying to fill I felt like you were telling my own story.


  I’ve struggled with yo-yo dieting and binge eating for over 15 years. That personal
  journey led me to create an app called **kkokkkok(꼭꼭)**, which in Korean means “to
  chew slowly and thoroughly.” Its core feature is a simple meal timer, and yet, just
  by slowing down and eating for 20 minutes, many users have begun to break free from
  their emotional eating patterns and binge cycles.


  We started quietly without any marketing, but now over 6,800 people in Korea are
  using kkokkkok. Based on real feedback from our users, we’ve continuously refined
  the app, and we’re currently developing a new feature that detects high-risk moments
  such as late at night or right after work and suggests alternative actions before
  a binge begins.


  Regarding GLP-1 medications, we view them as a double-edged sword. On one hand,
  they present an opportunity to build new, healthier habits during usage; on the
  other, we recognize the high risk of severe rebound effects post-cessation. We are
  designing both an app and coaching programs to support users through this transition.


  As you also emphasized in *Magic Pill*, we too are concerned about the misuse of
  GLP-1. In Korea, many women live with “hidden” eating disorders conditions that
  remain unrecognized even by those who suffer from them.


  While we are still in the early stages, our long-term vision is to help these women
  develop a healthier relationship with their bodies. At the same time, we aim to
  create a system digitally mirroring the underlying factors of compulsive eating
  such as nervous system and emotional patterns that offers a more affordable, accessible,
  and non-willpower-dependent alternative to medication. We believe software has the
  power to help rebuild one’s environment and habits, without shame or restriction.


  I wanted to share this because it feels like the messages in *The Magic Pill* are
  now taking shape as real tools in the world. The app is now available in English,
  and I would be incredibly honored if you’d give it a try:\

  If there’s ever a chance to briefly introduce our work, or even contribute a short
  guest piece about this approach, it would mean a great deal to us. Just as your
  book was a tremendous source of comfort to me, I hope our service can be a source
  of hope and help for others.


  With gratitude,\
