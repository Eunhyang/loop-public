notes: 'Dear Amanda Kooser,


  My name is Eunhyang Kim, and I’m the founder of a small wellness app in South Korea
  called **kkokkkok** a name that mimics the sound of eating slowly. I’m reaching
  out because I believe our story might resonate with your readers, especially those
  interested in emotional well-being, behavior change, and mindful tech.


  After struggling with binge eating and yo-yo dieting for over 15 years, I realized
  that what I and so many others truly needed wasn’t another restrictive plan, but
  a new relationship with food rooted in self-awareness.


  I started by sharing my story through a YouTube series called “Small Bite Diaries.”
  The responses were immediate and raw:


  > “I eat when I feel anxious, but I don’t know how to stop.”\

  > “Every time I try to control myself, I end up binging even more.”


  That’s when we built **kkokkkok**a completely free app that helps people slow down
  their eating, log their emotions, and build small recovery routines. It’s simple,
  gentle, and grounded in real human experience.


  Without any paid marketing, **over 6,800 people** in Korea have started using the
  app. Many tell us that it’s the first time they’ve felt truly supported not judged
  in their eating journey. Some have even used it during late-night cravings or post-stress
  episodes to stop and reflect instead of bingeing.


  The app includes:


  - A **timed eating tool** that guides slower meals (no buzzers or judgment)


  - A **mood tracker** that links feelings to eating patterns


  - A **gentle daily prompt** that builds mindful routines over time


  Interestingly, we later learned that similar concepts exist in the U.S., like HAPIfork,
  which uses hardware to slow eating. But we wanted to create something accessible
  to anyone with a smartphone no devices, no subscriptions, just support.


  If this story aligns with your editorial interests, I’d be happy to share more including
  screenshots, user stories, or data.\

  Here’s a direct link to try the app (in Korean for now, but we’re working on localization):\
