notes: 'Story idea re: post-GLP-1 rebound — a free behavior-support app used by 6,800+
  in Korea\

  \

  Dear Elizabeth Cooney,


  I’m Eunhyang Kim, founder of LOOP (The Lab of Eating Loops) in South Korea. I’m
  reaching out after reading your recent piece on what happens when people stop GLP-1
  drugs and the weight/health rebound that can follow (Jan 7, 2026).


  We’re building a free, behavior-first support app called **kkokkkok** (English available)
  that’s already used by **6,800+ people in Korea**—many of whom are dealing with
  binge eating or emotional overeating patterns. The core is intentionally simple:
  a **20-minute meal timer** to slow down eating + lightweight emotion/trigger tracking.
  We’re now developing “high-risk moment” prompts (after work, late night, etc.) to
  help users switch actions before compulsive eating starts.


  Why I think this could be a STAT-worthy angle:


  - GLP-1s can change appetite, but many people still struggle with the emotional
  and behavioral “why”—especially when stopping the medication.


  - We’re seeing demand for **post-GLP-1 habit rebuilding** (and rebound-minimization
  routines) that doesn’t rely on willpower or shame—something software can deliver
  at scale.


  - Korea has a large population of women with “hidden” disordered eating patterns,
  often unrecognized as a clinical issue—making low-friction tools particularly relevant.


  If you’re exploring the “what comes next” side of GLP-1s, I’d be happy to share:


  - anonymized aggregate usage patterns (e.g., time-of-day risk windows),


  - user-reported outcomes/quotes (non-medical),


  - and how we’re translating 1:1 coaching learnings into product design.


  If you’d like to take a quick look, here’s the download link:\

  Thank you for your reporting—your work helped sharpen our own focus on the gap between
  pharmacology and behavior. If this is of interest, I’m happy to answer questions
  by email or do a brief call at your convenience.


  Warm regards,\

  Eunhyang Kim\
