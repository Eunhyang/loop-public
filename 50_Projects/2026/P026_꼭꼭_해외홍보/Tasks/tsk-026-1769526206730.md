notes: 'i Alice,\

  I’m Eunhyang Kim from South Korea. I built a free app called kkokkkok after 15+
  years of yo-yo dieting and binge eating.\

  \

  It’s intentionally simple: a 20-minute meal timer + quick emotion/trigger notes.
  With no marketing, 6,800+ people in Korea use it, and many say slowing down helped
  them interrupt emotional overeating.\

  \

  With GLP-1 going mainstream, we’re focused on the layer meds often don’t address:
  emotion + habit loops. If you’re curious, I’d be honored if you tried it once:\

  If it feels relevant, I can share anonymized aggregate patterns + user quotes (non-medical).'
